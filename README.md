# IELTS-Score-Calculator 📚


## Welcome to the project!!!

#### Calculating your IELTS score can be difficult, especially for newcomers to the IELTS exam. However, it can be a simple process with the right tools and knowledge. 
#### The IELTS test comprises four components: ***Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking***. Each component is scored on a scale of 0-9, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. The scores from each component are then averaged to give you an overall band score.
